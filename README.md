**Programs on Sorting Electricity Bill Calculator, Bank balance and Final month Salary**

*Question 2*

You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, height) tuples by ascending order where

name is string, age and height are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:

  1: Sort based on name;

  2: Then sort based on age;

  3: Then sort by score.

The priority is that name > age > score.

If the following tuples are given as input to the program:

Tom,19,80

John,20,90

Jony,17,91

Jony,17,93

Json,21,85

Then, the output of the program should be:

[('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80')]
